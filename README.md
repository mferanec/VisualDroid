# VisualDroid

Hello and thank you for looking at my Java code.

This project began as the next stage of my previous project, Droid.

There is still much to do in this project, but for now I have mainly focussed on the visual side than the functionality. 

My plan is to add enemies which will move once the player moves(mines will not work in this project as the player could simply
hover around them, unless they're hidden in which case the gameboard would look very empty).
